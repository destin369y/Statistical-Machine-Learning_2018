Upload the code to Google Colab and run it. Here are the steps: 
	1. As I have said in our report, I have divided stage 2 test images (3000 of them) into 20 files 
		since uploading about 150 images to Google Colab is the max. 
		(Stage 1 test is fine, but stage 2 test file is too big). 
		In order to get the final csv file, I had to combine all twenty csvâ€™s generated manually.
	2. Also, the directory setting is set to be where my stage 2 test image belongs on my own laptop. 
		You might want to change it if it belongs to a different folder. 
	3. Finally, run the code in the jupyter notebook and it should generate the csv file and download it.
